Hi, welcome to my personal page. 

I am Yi Zhou, an associate professor in the computer science department of the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), Chengdu, P.R. China. I am also a member of the [Algorithms and Logic Lab](https://tcsuestc.com/) in UESTC.

I obtained PhD degree of Computer Science from the [Universit&eacute; d'Angers, France](https://www.univ-angers.fr/fr/index.html) in 2017. My PhD supervisor is Prof.  [Jin-Kao Hao](https://leria-info.univ-angers.fr/~jinkao.hao/), a [senior IUF member](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut_Universitaire_de_France). I got MS and BS degrees of Computer Science from UESTC in 2010 and 2013, respectively.

# Research 
I am interested in the design and analysis of practical algorithms, i.e., algorithms that work well in practice. In a more broad perspective, I study [Algorithm Engineering](aegroup/aegroup.md). My  recent work mainly focus on fast algorithms for some hard graph problems. 

You can refer to my [:material-file-sign:publications](research/publication.md) or my [DBLP](https://dblp.org/pid/01/1901-16.html) page.
