# The Algorithm Engineering Group in UESTC
I run the **Algorithm Engineering Group**(ALEG) in the Algorithms and Logic Lab.
By Wiki, [**Algorithm Engineering**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm_engineering) focus on the design, analysis, implementation, optimization, profiling and experimental evaluation of computer algorithms, bridging the gap between algorithm theory and practical applications of algorithms.

We currently work on some well-known hard combinatorial  optimization problems. We develop heuristics combinatorial search, integer linear programs, parallel methods etc., and investigate both their empirical and theoretical performances.

We have built some high-performance programs for solving:
- relaxed clique problems.
- steiner tree problems.
- cutting-stock problems. 
(Codes can be found from the my publication page.)


<font color=red>**NOTICE**</font>: we recruite talent **undergraduates** all the year round.
Drop me a mail if you are interested in optimization, coding, operations research etc.
