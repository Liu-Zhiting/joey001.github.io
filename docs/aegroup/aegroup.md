# The Algorithm Engineering Group in UESTC
I run the **Algorithm Engineering Group** in the Algorithms and Logic Lab.

[**Algorithm Engineering**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm_engineering)，by wikipedia, is subject focusing on the design, analysis, implementation, optimization, profiling and experimental evaluation of computer algorithms, bridging the gap between algorithm theory and practical applications of algorithms. 

We currently work on some intresting  combinatorial  optimization problems, including graph problems, industrial cutting (or packing) problems and scheduling problems.
We develop both exact and heuristics algorithms, integer linear programs, and even parallel methods. 
We investigate both their empirical and theoretical performances.

For example, we have built some high-performance programs for solving:  

1. relaxed clique problems. 
2. steiner tree problems. 
3. 2- and 3-dimensional cutting-stock problems. 
4. sattelite scheduling problems.

<font color=red>**NOTICE**</font>: we recruite  **undergraduates** all the year round.
If you are interested in join us, drop me a mail.

### Suggestions for future students
- UESTC undergraduates: UESTC undergraduates who want to do research with us can come to my office or send me a mail all the year round. But the research training is more helpful if you want to pursue a Master or Phd degree after graduation. 
- Non-UESTC undergraduates: If you conside me as a supervisor of your Master stduy, here are some tips. (1). Make sure that you want to study algorithms (which is a bit challenging in my view) (2) Make sure that you like writing and optimizing codes. (This is an extra requirement for doing algorithm engineering.) (3) Send me a mail as early as possible. (My mailbox is often flooded by application mails  in the last 1 or 2 days before the application portal is closed).  
 <!-- I feel sorry for not replying every application letter in the peaking time. Please try to highlight your advantages of doing the research.  -->
- Foreign students: I supervise few foreign master canidates. For application, it is better to have some studying or working experiences in China beforehand. Also, please highlight your advantages in doing the algorihmic research in your application letter.
