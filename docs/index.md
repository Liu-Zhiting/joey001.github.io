# About Me

<img src="./avartar.jpg" style="zoom:50%;" />

I am an associate professor in University of Electronic Science and Technology of China ([UESTC](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.uestc.edu.cn%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGLPW2kY6L6jIXrDW6OqlXkbImkRg)), Chengdu, P.R. China. I am also a member of the [Algorithms and Logic Group](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Ftcs.uestc.edu.cn%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFUDLBVTsYOfPjo2riWFZg-fkycXQ) in the School of Computer Science and Engineering.

I obtained the PhD degree of Computer Science from the [University of Angers](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.univ-angers.fr%2Ffr%2Findex.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHlrbDeBngpPRKuPrRPIM7fId8A-w), France in 2017. My PhD supervisor is [Jin-Kao Hao](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.info.univ-angers.fr%2F~hao%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGo1HwXiwErV6a7AQleee1XZDLO-g). I got  MS and BS degrees both from UESTC in 2010 and 2013, respectively.

I am interested in the design and analysis of practical algorithms, i.e., algorithms that work well in practice.  Recently, I mainly work on fast algorithms for graph optimization problems.
